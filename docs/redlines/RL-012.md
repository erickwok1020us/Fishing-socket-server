TYPE: RED_LINE
STATUS: RESOLVED

AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 1

## STATEMENT

No silent tamper. Any modification to game rules, config, or RNG must be detectable via receipts and hash-chains.

## SOURCE

Bible Final Guarantees: "No silent tamper"

## VIOLATION RESPONSE

STOP. Implement tamper detection (M5 receipts + M6 rules hash).

## TEST CRITERIA
