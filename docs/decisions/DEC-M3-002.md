# DEC-M3-002: Seed Commit Scheme

TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: UNRESOLVED
SCOPE: LOCAL
MODULE: M3 — Crypto Fairness (ZK HP)
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 0

## QUESTION

Server-only seed or player commit-reveal mixed entropy for HP determination?

## CONTEXT

- Bible M3: "Server seed commit, Player commit-reveal mixed entropy, Prevent seed grinding"
- Current: SeededRNG uses Mulberry32 (fish3DGameEngine.js lines 20-43), not cryptographic
- Current: CSPRNG exists (src/rng/CSPRNG.js) but not used for HP commitment
- Mixed entropy means player contributes randomness server cannot predict

## OPTIONS

| Option | Description | Fairness Guarantee |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| A | Server-only CSPRNG seed (server commits hash before spawn) | Proves server didn't change HP after seeing bets |
| B | Mixed entropy: server seed + player seed combined | Neither party can predict or grind |
| C | Server-only, no commitment (current — trust the server) | No proof of fairness |

## DEPENDENCIES

- Requires: DEC-M3-001 (if ZK deferred, this may be deferred too)

## ALLOWED ACTIONS

NONE.

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

- Do not modify SeededRNG or CSPRNG
- Do not add commitment schemes
