# DEC-M2-001: RTP Target Value

TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: UNRESOLVED
SCOPE: GLOBAL
MODULE: M2 — Economy & RTP
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 0

## QUESTION

What is the correct RTP target: 99% perfect-hit (as Bible M2 states) or 91-95% per weapon (as current code implements)?

## CONTEXT

- Bible M2 states: "Target: Perfect-hit RTP = 99%"
- Bible M2 formula: "Payout = 0.99 x BulletCost x ExpectedBullets"
- Current code (fish3DGameEngine.js lines 230-235): 1x=91%, 3x=93%, 5x=94%, 8x=95%
- Current code (game.js line 777-779): Same 91-95% values
- "Perfect-hit RTP = 99%" means: if player hits every shot perfectly, long-term return = 99%
- Per-weapon RTP (91-95%) means: each weapon has different return rate
- These two models are fundamentally different economic designs

## OPTIONS

| Option | Description | House Edge | Player Experience |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| A | 99% perfect-hit RTP (Bible spec) | 1% on perfect play | High skill reward, low house edge |
| B | 91-95% per-weapon RTP (current code) | 5-9% per weapon | Weapon choice matters, higher house edge |
| C | Hybrid: 99% perfect-hit with weapon-tier modifiers | Variable | Complex but flexible |

## DEPENDENCIES

- Blocks: DEC-M2-002, DEC-M2-003, DEC-M2-004
- Blocks all M2 Economy implementation
- Affects: RTP simulator target, payout formula, reward split

## ALLOWED ACTIONS

NONE. Decision must be resolved before any economy changes.

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

- Do not change RTP values in code
- Do not build RTP simulator without confirmed target
- Do not assume either model
