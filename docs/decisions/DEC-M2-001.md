# DEC-M2-001: RTP Target Value

TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: RESOLVED
SCOPE: GLOBAL
MODULE: M2 — Economy & RTP
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 1

## RESOLUTION

**Option B: Keep current per-weapon RTP (91-95%)**

RTP values remain as currently implemented: 1x=91%, 3x=93%, 5x=94%, 8x=95%. This overrides Bible M2's "Perfect-hit RTP = 99%" specification.

RESOLVED BY: User directive (2026-02-09) — "RTP 先保留目前設定"

## RATIONALE

- Current per-weapon RTP creates meaningful weapon choice differentiation
- Higher-cost weapons reward players with better return rate
- 5-9% house edge per weapon provides sustainable economic model
- User explicitly chose to keep current implementation

## BIBLE OVERRIDE NOTE

This decision overrides Bible M2: "Target: Perfect-hit RTP = 99%". The Bible spec is superseded by user directive. POL-RTP-001 updated accordingly.

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Weapon RTP values: { 1x: 0.91, 3x: 0.93, 5x: 0.94, 8x: 0.95 }
- Reward formula: Reward = sum(bulletCost x weaponRTP) for each contributing bullet
- No change to existing fish3DGameEngine.js or game.js RTP values
- RTP simulator target: per-weapon values +/- 0.5% over 1M kills

## DEPENDENCIES UNBLOCKED

- DEC-M2-002, DEC-M2-003, DEC-M2-004
- All M2 Economy implementation
