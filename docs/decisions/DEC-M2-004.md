## QUESTION

Is a 1M kill RTP simulation required before launch, and what is the pass threshold?

## CONTEXT

- Bible M2: "Simulator Required: 1M kill simulation, RTP = 99% +/- 0.1%"
- Current: tests/certification/rtp.verification.test.js exists but targets per-weapon RTP (91-95%), not 99%
- Simulation validates the entire economic model before real money is at stake

## OPTIONS

|--------|-------------|-----------|
| A | Required: 1M simulation at 99% +/- 0.1% (Bible spec) | Highest |
| B | Required: 1M simulation at per-weapon RTP +/- 0.5% | High |
| C | Not required for single-player MVP, add for multiplayer | Lower |

## DEPENDENCIES

- Requires: DEC-M2-001 (determines target RTP)

## ALLOWED ACTIONS

NONE.

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

- Do not modify RTP test suite
- Do not run certification tests until RTP target is confirmed
