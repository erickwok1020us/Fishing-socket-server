# DEC-M2-004: RTP Simulator Requirement

TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: RESOLVED
SCOPE: GLOBAL
MODULE: M2 — Economy & RTP
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 1

## RESOLUTION

**Option B: Required — 1M simulation at per-weapon RTP +/- 0.5%**

RTP simulator MUST run 1M kill simulation per weapon type. Each weapon's measured RTP must fall within +/- 0.5% of its target (1x=91%, 3x=93%, 5x=94%, 8x=95%).

RESOLVED BY: Technical requirement — per DEC-M2-001, RTP targets are per-weapon, not 99%

## RATIONALE

- Per-weapon RTP (DEC-M2-001) requires per-weapon validation
- +/- 0.5% tolerance is practical for 1M sample size
- Existing test infrastructure (tests/certification/rtp.verification.test.js) can be adapted
- Simulation validates the economic model before real money is at stake

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Update rtp.verification.test.js to target per-weapon RTP values
- Run 1M kills per weapon type (4M total)
- Pass criteria: measured RTP within target +/- 0.5%
- Output: per-weapon RTP report with confidence intervals
- Must pass before any economy code ships to production
