# DEC-M5-003: Verifier Tool Implementation

TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: RESOLVED
SCOPE: LOCAL
MODULE: M5 — Audit & Receipts
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 1

## RESOLUTION

**Option A: Client-side JS in browser**

Verifier runs as client-side JavaScript in the player's browser. Player can independently verify receipt chain without trusting server.

RESOLVED BY: Technical analysis — client-side verification aligns with zero-trust philosophy

## RATIONALE

- Client-side verification means player does not need to trust any third party
- JavaScript runs in same environment as the game (browser)
- No additional server infrastructure needed
- Player can verify offline (download receipts + verifier)
- Bible M5: "UI can display fairness receipt" — implies in-browser capability

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Verifier module: standalone JS file loadable in browser
- Input: array of receipt JSON objects (from session)
- Checks: hash-chain integrity, seed commitment matches revealed seed, rules_hash matches expected config
- Output: PASS/FAIL per receipt + overall chain verdict
- UI integration: "Verify Fairness" button in game UI shows receipt list and verification status
