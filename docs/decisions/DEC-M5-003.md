TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: UNRESOLVED
SCOPE: LOCAL
MODULE: M5 — Audit & Receipts
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 0

## QUESTION

Should the verifier tool be client-side JavaScript, a separate service, or both?

## CONTEXT

- Bible M5: "Provide verifier tool, UI can display fairness receipt"
- Current: No verifier tool exists
- Verifier = tool that lets players independently verify receipt validity
- Must verify: hash-chain integrity, proof correctness, rules_hash match

## OPTIONS

| Option | Description | Trust Model |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| A | Client-side JS in browser | Player can verify without trusting server |
| B | Separate verification service (API) | Centralized but simpler |
| C | Both: client-side primary, API backup | Best coverage |

## DEPENDENCIES

- Requires: DEC-M5-001, DEC-M5-002
- Requires: DEC-M3-001 (if ZK proofs exist, verifier must check them)

## ALLOWED ACTIONS

NONE.

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

- Do not build verifier tool
