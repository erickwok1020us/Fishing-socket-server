# DEC-M2-002: Finisher Pool Implementation

TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: UNRESOLVED
SCOPE: LOCAL
MODULE: M2 — Economy & RTP
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 0

## QUESTION

Implement 2-10% finisher bonus pool or keep 100% contribution-based reward split?

## CONTEXT

- Bible M2: "Reward Split: 90-98% by contribution, 2-10% finisher pool"
- Current code: 100% by RTP-weighted cost contribution, no finisher pool
- Finisher pool incentivizes last-hit strategy
- Single-player mode: finisher concept is irrelevant (only 1 player)

## OPTIONS

| Option | Description | Single-Player Impact |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| A | Implement finisher pool per Bible (2-10%) | No effect in single-player (always the finisher) |
| B | Skip finisher pool, implement for multiplayer later | Simpler, no single-player impact |
| C | Implement but set to 0% for single-player, configurable for multiplayer | Future-proof |

## DEPENDENCIES

- Requires: DEC-M2-001 (RTP target affects pool size)

## ALLOWED ACTIONS

NONE.

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

- Do not modify reward distribution code
