# DEC-M2-002: Finisher Pool Implementation

TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: RESOLVED
SCOPE: LOCAL
MODULE: M2 — Economy & RTP
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 1

## RESOLUTION

**Option C: Implement but set to 0% for single-player, configurable for multiplayer**

Finisher pool code exists in architecture but is set to 0% for single-player. Configurable parameter for future multiplayer use.

RESOLVED BY: Technical analysis — single-player has only 1 player (always the finisher), so pool is meaningless

## RATIONALE

- Single-player: player always gets 100% (sole contributor and finisher)
- Code should be future-proof for multiplayer
- Config parameter FINISHER_POOL_PERCENT defaults to 0 for single-player
- Multiplayer can set 2-10% per Bible M2

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Add FINISHER_POOL_PERCENT to game config (default: 0)
- Single-player rooms: force to 0
- Multiplayer rooms: configurable 2-10%
- Reward = (1 - FINISHER_POOL_PERCENT) x contributionShare + FINISHER_POOL_PERCENT x finisherBonus
