What is the maximum acceptable latency window for lag compensation, and how should it be implemented?

## CONTEXT

| B | 200ms | Moderate — balances fairness and playability |
| C | 500ms | Loose — very forgiving, potential abuse window |
| D | None (if DEC-M1-001 = client-side) | N/A for offline single-player |
