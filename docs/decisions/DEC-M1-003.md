# DEC-M1-003: Bounded Lag Compensation

TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: RESOLVED
SCOPE: LOCAL
MODULE: M1 — Network & Authority
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 1

## RESOLUTION

**Option B: 200ms maximum lag compensation window**

Server accepts hit events with up to 200ms latency tolerance. Events older than 200ms are rejected with explicit error.

RESOLVED BY: Technical analysis — balances fairness and playability for Render-hosted backend

## RATIONALE

- Render backend latency typically 50-200ms depending on user location
- 200ms window covers most players without enabling abuse
- Tighter (100ms) would frustrate high-latency players
- Looser (500ms) creates exploitable timing windows

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Server timestamps all fish positions
- Client sends shoot event with client timestamp
- Server compares: if (serverTime - clientTime > 200ms) reject
- Rejected events return explicit error to client (per RL-005)
- Log latency statistics for monitoring
