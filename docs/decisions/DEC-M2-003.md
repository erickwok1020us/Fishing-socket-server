# DEC-M2-003: Reward Rounding Remainder Policy

TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: RESOLVED
SCOPE: LOCAL
MODULE: M2 — Economy & RTP
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 1

## RESOLUTION

**Option A: Last player gets remainder (keep current implementation)**

Remainder from deterministic rounding goes to the last contributing player. For single-player, this is always the only player.

RESOLVED BY: Technical analysis — current implementation is correct for single-player, and acceptable for multiplayer

## RATIONALE

- Single-player: only 1 player, remainder always goes to them (zero impact)
- Current code already implements this (fish3DGameEngine.js line 941)
- No code change needed
- For multiplayer: slight bias to last contributor, but negligible over many kills

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- No changes required — keep existing rounding logic
- Verify in RTP simulator that remainder does not skew per-weapon RTP
