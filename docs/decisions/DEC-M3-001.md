# DEC-M3-001: ZK HP Proofs for MVP

TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: RESOLVED
SCOPE: GLOBAL
MODULE: M3 — Crypto Fairness (ZK HP)
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 1

## RESOLUTION

**Option B: Seed commit only (no ZK proof, but HP commitment)**

MVP implements seed commitment scheme (server publishes hash of seed before fish spawn). Full ZK proofs deferred to post-launch.

RESOLVED BY: Technical analysis — ZK proofs are highest complexity module, seed commitment provides fairness baseline

## RATIONALE

- Full ZK proving system requires weeks of development (cryptographic circuits)
- Seed commitment already proves server did not change HP after seeing bets
- Bible Integration Strategy supports phased approach (Shadow -> Soft -> Full)
- Single-player focus reduces urgency (operator = developer, trust level higher)
- Seed commitment is a prerequisite for ZK anyway — no wasted work

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Server generates CSPRNG seed per spawn batch
- Server publishes SHA-256(seed) as commitment before spawning fish
- HP derived deterministically from seed (see DEC-M3-003)
- On fish death, server reveals seed — client can verify HP was pre-committed
- proof_reference field in receipts: set to commitment hash (not ZK proof)
- ZK proof circuit design can proceed in parallel as Phase 2 work

## DEPENDENCIES UNBLOCKED

- DEC-M3-002, DEC-M3-003
- M5 receipts (proof_reference = commitment hash)
