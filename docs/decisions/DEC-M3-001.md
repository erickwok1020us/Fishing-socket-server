# DEC-M3-001: ZK HP Proofs for MVP

TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: UNRESOLVED
SCOPE: GLOBAL
MODULE: M3 — Crypto Fairness (ZK HP)
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 0

## QUESTION

Should Zero-Knowledge HP proofs be implemented for the MVP release, or deferred to post-launch?

## CONTEXT

- Bible M3 specifies full ZK HP system: seed commit, HP derivation, kill-time proof
- Current implementation: 0% of M3 is implemented
- ZK proofs are the most complex module (cryptographic proving systems)
- Bible Integration Strategy suggests phased approach: Shadow -> Soft -> Full Enforcement
- Single-player mode is current focus
- ZK proofs primarily protect against operator cheating (proving HP was fair)

## OPTIONS

| Option | Description | Effort | Risk |
|--------|-------------|--------|------|
| A | Full ZK HP for MVP | Very High (weeks) | Delays launch significantly |
| B | Seed commit only (no ZK proof, but HP commitment) | Medium (days) | Partial fairness, no proof verification |
| C | Defer entirely to post-launch | Zero | No fairness proof at launch |
| D | Shadow mode: compute but don't enforce | Medium | Good data, no user impact |

## DEPENDENCIES

- Requires: DEC-M1-001 (server authority model)
- Blocks: DEC-M3-002, DEC-M3-003
- Affects: M5 (receipts need proof_reference field)

## ALLOWED ACTIONS

NONE. Decision must be resolved before any M3 implementation.

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

- Do not implement any ZK proving system
- Do not add cryptographic commitment schemes
- Do not modify HP derivation logic
