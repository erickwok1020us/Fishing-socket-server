# DEC-M4-001: Statistical Anomaly Detection

TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: RESOLVED
SCOPE: LOCAL
MODULE: M4 — Anti-Cheat
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 1

## RESOLUTION

**Option A: Z-score on hit rate**

Flag players whose hit rate exceeds 3 standard deviations from the expected mean for their weapon type.

RESOLVED BY: Technical analysis — simplest effective algorithm, sufficient for single-player MVP

## RATIONALE

- Z-score is simple to implement and computationally cheap
- 3-sigma threshold gives <0.3% false positive rate
- Per-weapon tracking accounts for different weapon hit profiles
- Can be enhanced with Options B/C for multiplayer later
- Server already has hit/miss data from authority model (DEC-M1-001)

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Track per-session: hits, misses, total shots per weapon type
- Expected hit rate derived from weapon stats and fish density
- Z = (observedHitRate - expectedHitRate) / stdDev
- If Z > 3.0: flag session for review, log evidence
- Do NOT auto-ban or auto-disconnect (per RL-005, no silent punishment)
- Flagged sessions logged with full evidence for manual review
