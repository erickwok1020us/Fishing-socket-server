# DEC-M4-002: Quarantine Rooms

TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: RESOLVED
SCOPE: LOCAL
MODULE: M4 — Anti-Cheat
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 1

## RESOLUTION

**Option B: Multiplayer only (skip for single-player)**

Quarantine rooms deferred to multiplayer implementation. Single-player uses rate limiting + disconnect for violations.

RESOLVED BY: Technical analysis — quarantine rooms are meaningless for single-player (only 1 player)

## RATIONALE

- Single-player: "quarantine room" = the player's own room (no isolation possible)
- Rate limiting (RateLimiter.js) already catches fire rate violations
- Disconnect after repeated violations is sufficient for single-player
- Quarantine rooms add value in multiplayer (isolate cheater from honest players)

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Single-player: violations trigger explicit rejection + warning (per RL-005)
- After N violations in a session: disconnect with reason
- Violation threshold: configurable (suggest 10 violations per session)
- Quarantine room logic to be designed when multiplayer resumes
