# DEC-M1-001: Server Authority for Single-Player Mode

TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: RESOLVED
SCOPE: GLOBAL
MODULE: M1 — Network & Authority
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 1

## RESOLUTION

**Option A: Server-authoritative single-player (connect to backend like multiplayer)**

Single-player mode MUST route all game logic through the backend server via WebSocket. Single-player = multiplayer room with 1 player.

RESOLVED BY: User directive (2026-02-09)

## RATIONALE

- Full M1 compliance with server authority
- Reuses 100% of existing multiplayer server code
- True server authority — client cannot tamper
- Same security model for all game modes
- Simplest implementation path

## TRADE-OFFS ACCEPTED

- Requires internet connection (no offline play)
- Latency depends on user location to Render server (50-200ms)
- Single point of failure (server downtime = no game)

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Single-player connects to Render backend via Socket.IO (same as multiplayer)
- Server creates a 1-player room
- All hit detection, RTP, rewards computed server-side
- Client sends shoot events, receives results
- No client-side game logic for outcomes

## DEPENDENCIES UNBLOCKED

- DEC-M1-002, DEC-M1-003, DEC-TECH-001
- All M1-M6 single-player implementation
