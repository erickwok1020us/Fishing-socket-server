TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: UNRESOLVED
SCOPE: LOCAL
MODULE: M4 — Anti-Cheat
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 0

## QUESTION

Current code silently drops excess shots (fish3DServer.js line 391). Change to explicit rejection?

## CONTEXT

- Bible M4: "Forbidden: No silent punishment"
- Current: Rate limiter silently drops shots when limit exceeded
- Current: Comment in code says "Silently drop excess shots"
- Bible requires all enforcement be logged and visible
- RL-005 (Red Line): No silent punishment

## OPTIONS

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | Explicit rejection: send error event to client with reason | Bible compliant, player knows |
| B | Explicit rejection + UI warning | Best UX, full compliance |
| C | Keep silent drop (current) | VIOLATES RL-005 |

## DEPENDENCIES

- None (can be resolved independently)

## ALLOWED ACTIONS

NONE until resolved. However, Option C is FORBIDDEN per RL-005.

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

- Do not keep silent punishment (violates Red Line RL-005)
