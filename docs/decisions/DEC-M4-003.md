# DEC-M4-003: Silent Punishment Policy

TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: RESOLVED
SCOPE: LOCAL
MODULE: M4 — Anti-Cheat
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 1

## RESOLUTION

**Option A: Explicit rejection — send error event to client with reason**

All rate-limited or rejected shots MUST send an error event back to the client with a clear reason. No silent drops allowed.

RESOLVED BY: RL-005 mandate (no silent punishment) — Option C is FORBIDDEN

## RATIONALE

- RL-005 (Red Line): "No silent punishment — all enforcement actions MUST be logged and player MUST be notified"
- Current code (fish3DServer.js line 391) silently drops excess shots — VIOLATION
- Explicit rejection lets legitimate players know if they hit a bug or latency issue
- Logging all rejections provides audit trail for anti-cheat analysis

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Replace silent drop in fish3DServer.js:391 with:
  1. socket.emit('shootRejected', { reason: 'RATE_LIMITED', cooldownRemaining: ms })
  2. Log: { event: 'SHOT_REJECTED', playerId, reason, timestamp }
- All enforcement actions must emit both client event AND server log
- Error event types: RATE_LIMITED, REPLAY_DETECTED, LAG_EXCEEDED, INVALID_TARGET

## FIXES RED LINE VIOLATION

- RL-005: Was VIOLATED, will be COMPLIANT after implementation
