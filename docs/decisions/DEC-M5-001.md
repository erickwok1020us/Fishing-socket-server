# DEC-M5-001: Audit Receipts for Single-Player

TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: RESOLVED
SCOPE: GLOBAL
MODULE: M5 — Audit & Receipts
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 1

## RESOLUTION

**Option B: Simplified receipt (no proof_reference as ZK proof, use commitment hash instead)**

FishDeath receipts implemented for single-player with all Bible fields. proof_reference = seed commitment hash (not ZK proof, per DEC-M3-001).

RESOLVED BY: Technical analysis — receipts are essential for fairness proof even in single-player

## RATIONALE

- Receipts prove operator is not rigging outcomes (RL-009)
- Single-player receipts enable player to verify fairness independently
- Simplified: proof_reference = commitment hash instead of ZK proof (per DEC-M3-001)
- rules_hash included per DEC-M6-001

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- FishDeath receipt schema:
  { fish_id, total_damage, player_damage[], payout_total, payout_split[], finisher_bonus, rules_hash, proof_reference }
- proof_reference = SHA-256(seed) commitment hash
- rules_hash = config hash from DEC-M6-001
- Single-player: player_damage[] has 1 entry, payout_split[] has 1 entry
- finisher_bonus = 0 for single-player (per DEC-M2-002)
