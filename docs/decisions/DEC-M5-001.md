TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: UNRESOLVED
SCOPE: GLOBAL
MODULE: M5 — Audit & Receipts
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 0

## QUESTION

Should FishDeath audit receipts be implemented for single-player mode?

## CONTEXT

- Bible M5: "Every FishDeath emits: { fish_id, total_damage, player_damage[], payout_total, payout_split[], finisher_bonus, rules_hash, proof_reference }"
- Current: fishKilled event exists but missing: total_damage, player_damage[], finisher_bonus, rules_hash, proof_reference
- Receipts prove fairness to players and regulators
- Single-player receipts prove the operator isn't rigging outcomes

## OPTIONS

| Option | Description | Value |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| A | Full receipt schema per Bible | Casino compliance ready |
| B | Simplified receipt (no proof_reference, no rules_hash) | Partial transparency |
| C | Defer to multiplayer launch | No single-player audit trail |

## DEPENDENCIES

- Requires: DEC-M1-001 (server must generate receipts)
- Requires: DEC-M3-001 (proof_reference depends on ZK implementation)
- Requires: DEC-M6-001 (rules_hash depends on signed config)

## ALLOWED ACTIONS

NONE.

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

- Do not modify fishKilled event schema
- Do not add receipt generation code
