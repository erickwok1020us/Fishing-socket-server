TYPE: DECISION
STATUS: UNRESOLVED
SCOPE: GLOBAL
MODULE: M6 — Release & Immutability
AI_ACTION_ALLOWED: 0

## QUESTION

Should config signing be implemented for MVP, and what signing mechanism?

## CONTEXT

- Bible M6: "Signed config, Rules hash versioning"
- Current: No config signing, no rules hash
- Config includes: WEAPONS, FISH_SPECIES, RTP values, cooldown values
- Signed config prevents operator from silently changing fairness rules
- rules_hash is required in every receipt (Bible M5)

## OPTIONS

| Option | Signing Method | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| A | HMAC-SHA256 with server secret | Simple, server can verify own config |
| B | Ed25519 asymmetric signing | Third party can verify, stronger guarantee |
| C | SHA256 hash only (no signing, just versioning) | Detects changes but no authentication |
| D | Defer to post-MVP | No immutability guarantee |

## DEPENDENCIES

- Blocks: DEC-M5-001 (receipts need rules_hash)

## ALLOWED ACTIONS

NONE.

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

- Do not add config signing code
- Do not modify game configuration structure
